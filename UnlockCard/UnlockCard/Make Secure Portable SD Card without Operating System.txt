In Windows partition SD card with 2 partitions


diskpart

list disk

select disk xxx

list partition

select partition 1
delete partition

create partition primary size=150 offset=4096
select partition 1
format fs=fat32 label='comm'
list partition

create partition primary
select partition 2
format fs=fat32 label='data'
list partition



then, with Card Manager:

1. set security flags
	uncheck "secure pin entry"
	check "multiple partition protection"

2. create protection profiles

	1. public cd rom
	2. private rw

3. activate data protection




You can now use this "portable secure card" like an USB stick
and use it on Windows (with card manager which you can copy to
the CD ROM partition prior to enabling the data protection),
or Linux with the UnlockCard scripts (which you can also copy

Note: On Windows, the private RW will always show an error
because its data is only available when login was successful.


Warning:
On Linux you must have 2 partitions on the card,
otherwise data on the first partition will always be reset,
like it is a cd rom partition.

On Windows, it is fine to have only one partition
with multiple partition protection disabled.

But in order to be portable between Linux and Windows,
you should have 2 partitions.
